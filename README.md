# Wordle-Game

### This is a simple clone of the popular game called "Wordle", made using Tkinter module in Python.
In this game there's a fixed size of blanks and we have to guess the word, with each guess we also get the hint as below : 
* If the guess is right, all the letter changes to Green.
* If a particular letter in the guess is also in the actual word, but i's not in the right position then that letter's color changes to Yellow.
* if a particular letter in the guess is also in the actual word, and it's in the right position then that letter's color changes to Green.

#### Features
* Can change the word size (three, four or five)
* Can also change the high score (i mean it doesn't make sense having this feature, right? but quite handy if you are not able to reach certain high score then you can use this hack)
